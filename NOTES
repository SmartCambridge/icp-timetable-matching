Import the timetable for a particular day (encoded in the source,
currently 2017-10-27):

'''PYTHONPATH=../operating_profile/ ./timetable_journey_extractor.py
../TNDS_bus_data/sections/ | pgloader timetable_journeys.load'''

(script currently extracts EA+EM+SE regions only)

Load siri-vm.json data for 2017-10-27:

'''./sirivm_journey_extractor.py
../siri/sirivm_json/data_bin/2017/10/27/ | pgloader

Looking at data for Friday 27 October 2017

Using TNDS data for EA+EM+SE Extracted 113574 timetabled
journeys.

The timetable includes 2097 different journeys with duplicate
departure time and origin. And 564 with duplicate departure time,
origin and destination.

Many of these look as if they may be actually duplicated journeys,
either as part of the same Service/Line (and so TNDS file), or split
across Service/Lines (files).

6199 distinct SIRI VM journeys based on departure time, origin and
destination.

Joining SIRI journeys on Timetable journeys by departure time, 
origin and destination gives 6202 rows, of which 5758 (93%) matched and
444 (7%) didn't.

So, 6199 journeys of which 444 didn't match leaves 5755 that did. 5758
matched rows for 5755 journeys means we got three extra records as a
result of duplication. In this case this was as a result of three
records each of which were duplicated once.
